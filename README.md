ðŸš€ Harnessing LangExtract + OpenAI API for Smarter Web Scraping
I recently tried out LangExtract, a powerful openâ€‘source Python library by Google, paired with the OpenAI API, and I'm impressedâ€”itâ€™s hands down one of the best tools Iâ€™ve used for intelligent web scraping and structured data extraction.

What Is LangExtract?
LangExtract is a Geminiâ€‘powered library built to take unstructured textâ€”from websites, documents, or feedbackâ€”and turn it into structured, grounded data. You define:

A prompt with extraction requirements

Fewâ€‘shot examples showing the schema
and LangExtract handles the rest, even across long documents using chunking and multiâ€‘pass processing

Why It Stands Out
Source grounding: Each extraction is tied to exact character offsets, so you can trace where every piece of data came from

Schema enforcement: Controlled generation ensures consistent output formats, reducing hallucinations and mismatches

How I Used It
python
Copy
Edit
import textwrap
import langextract as lx

prompt = textwrap.dedent("""\
Extract company name, financial metrics, and market sentiment.
Use exact text only. Do not paraphrase.
Provide useful attributes:
- company â†’ include ticker
- metric â†’ type and value
- sentiment â†’ bullish / bearish / neutral
""")

examples = [
  lx.data.ExampleData(
    text="AlphaTech (AT) announced a quarterly profit of $2.5 billionâ€¦ strongly bullish trend",
    extractions=[
      lx.data.Extraction("company", "AlphaTech", {"stock_ticker":"AT"}),
      lx.data.Extraction("financial_metric","quarterly profit of $2.5 billion",{"metric_type":"profit","value":"$2.5â€¯billion"}),
      lx.data.Extraction("market_sentiment","strongly bullish trend",{"sentiment":"bullish"})
    ]
  )
]

result = lx.extract(
  text_or_documents="Global Dynamics Inc. (GDI) reported quarterly revenue of $15Bâ€¦ stock dipped 2%, cautious sentiment.",
  prompt_description=prompt,
  examples=examples,
  model_id="geminiâ€‘2.5â€‘pro"
)
That returned perfectly structured JSON along with source offsetsâ€”and you can immediately view it in an HTML visualizer.

TL;DR Summary
Benefit	Why It Matters
Traceable output	See where every piece of data was extracted
Schema guarantees	Promptâ€‘based structure ensures consistent output
Scalable to long docs	Chunking + multiâ€‘pass improves recall
Domainâ€‘agnostic	Works equally well for finance, healthcare, legal, etc.
